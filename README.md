# Use Transit Gateway to create a single exit point to the internet from multiple VPCs

## Introduction

The cloudformation in this project are intended to be used in support of the AWS blog article here: [creating-a-single-internet-exit-point-from-multiple-vpcs-using-aws-transit-gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/creating-a-single-internet-exit-point-from-multiple-vpcs-using-aws-transit-gateway)

The cloudformation automatically creates the solution highlighted in the blog, and will populate the VPC route tables with the correct routes after creation of the transit gateway attachments. This function has recently been added to cloudformation.

The purpose of the cloudformation is to create this architecture ...

## Create AWS services

Before, create a `key pair` with name [transit-gateway-key-pair](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home?region=eu-west-1#CreateKeyPair) to link EC2 instances and copy into base project path

```bash
./init-aws-transit-gateway.sh
```

## Testing scripts

```bash
./connect-aws-transit-gateway.sh
```

![Test Support](images/TRG-CF-AWS-TEST-SUPPORT.gif)

## Delete AWS services

```bash
./delete-aws-transit-gateway.sh
```

## Costs

This architecture costs ...
